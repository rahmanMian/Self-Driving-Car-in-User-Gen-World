The project began with arrow-key-controlled car movement on a straight road. A ray function detected road borders, and collision detection was implemented. Traffic elements were added with extended collision detection. A machine learning algorithm featured levels, neurons, and output for autonomous car control. It used weights, biases, and a feedforward algorithm. A mutate function accelerated evolution for multiple cars. The fitness function evaluated performance based on the lowest y-value(y decreases upwards). The simulation allowed saving the "best car" instead of starting anew, enhancing efficiency. This project combines game development, simulation, and machine learning for autonomous car navigation. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask!





2. WORLD is the second part of the Autonomous Car Project. Built purely with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. No Libraries!

The user is allowed to make their own "World" using Spatial Graphs. This is done by simply using Points and Segments to connect them.
Once in place, this graph utilizes user input to set the points in place. The segments connect the points to each other. These segments are
then encompasses by envelopes to give the road a more natural look. Trees and Buildings are then generated around the road to give it a more
natural feel. The 3d aspect of the trees and buildings are all given by simple math equations such as linear interpolation.

The user also has the option to add different markings in the map such as a yeild, parking, lights, crosswalk, start point, and a end point. 
The lights are the only marking with a special algorithm to change colours.

The user has an option to save the world to local storage for later. This is done by coverting the world in JSON values and locally storing them.

3. Car-In-World is the final part of the Autonomous Car Project. Built purely with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.No Libraries!

Now, users can actively develop maps and assess their car's machine learning algorithm. By utilizing a script in Overpass Turbo, real-world data from OpenStreetMap can be easily extracted. 
In a recent demo, I replicated my neighborhood streets for the car's testing purposes. Explore these practical features for hands-on map development and algorithm evaluation.
